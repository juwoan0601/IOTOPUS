# IOTOPUS
Smart home project with Raspberry Pi and Arduino

# System Requirement
- IoT Hub: Raspberry 4 (use Rasbian Lite os)
- IoT Slave Device MCU: Arduino Nano (but this will change Arduino Micro Pro)
- IoT Wed development workframe for server: Flask (with python 3.8.X)
- IoT Hub to Slave Communitation: Bluetooth 3.0 with HC-06
- IoT Hub to Internet(Web) Communication: WiFi
- Raspberry Pi Debugger: PuTTy and Filezilla by SSH
- Demo Environment: Web browser

# Overview
- IOTOPUS/webapp/: sources for web application 
- IOTOPUS/hardware/: sources for IoT Slave device with arduino
- raspberrypi/: sources for raspberrypi SSH and WiFi setting

# TO DO
- Improve Response time between hub and slave
- Improve Web Page Design
